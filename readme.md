The project idea is to create an awareness of Beats Studio headphone to the customers worldwide.
Used The Beats Skyline Collection Shadow Grey to please the customers in buying this product.           

To increase the conversion rate and generate the app, I have used Node and Express to generate the app.    
Handlebars are used as a template.  GitHub repo and Heroku are used to host this app.

## Tools used during development phase:
- Photoshop
- Adobe xd
- Node.js
